# 🌙 30NitesOfCode

A collection of mini-games built with Python and Pygame during the **[30NitesOfCode](https://www.codedex.io/)** challenge by Codédex.

This project fills the calm, quiet space of the early summer holidays — one mini-game at a time.  
No pressure, no expectations. Just code, creativity, and a bit of fun every night.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To stay connected with Python while I dive into other languages (hello, Java 👋),  
and to enjoy building small, playful projects through the simple joy of making.

---

## 🕹️ Mini-Games

Each game lives in its own file and can be launched from a shared menu.

---

## 💻 How to run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
3. run the laucher python main.py

This isn’t about performance or polish — it’s about curiosity and joy.
Some games will be polished, others experimental or silly. That’s the fun of it.
